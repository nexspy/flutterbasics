## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## My Notes

Keeping widgets inside Column children will automatically take small space as possible. To make it
expand to available space, wrap it with Expanded class.
